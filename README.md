Bovet Method is an empirical analysis-based Francis Turbine design method presented in 1963.
The method has been proposed and used by different authors. It is implemented here on
as Matlab Tool to generate Meridoinal Profile. In the Bovet method, the important parameters required for the design of the runner are Head (H),flow rate(Q), and rotational speed(N). The method can design meridoinal profile for all the sites with dimensionless specific speed between 0.1 to 0.8
